# extensions

The Twitch **extensions** repo contains the source of the frontend apps that are
rendered within the Twitch app to enrich the viewer experience with additional
information and interactivity:

This repo currently contains a single extension: an app that's intended to render
information about the tape that's currently being viewed.
